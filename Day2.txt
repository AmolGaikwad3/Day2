Q.1 Difference between documents and window objects.
 DOCUMENT OBJECTS- When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
                  The document object represents the whole html document as a tree of Objects(HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags). 
                  It is the root element that represents the html document.
    
    Syntax: document.property_name;
    
    Properties:title,head,activeElement,body,domain,URL,fullScreenElement etc.
    
    Methods: document.method_name;
             close(), createComment(), getElementById(), hasFocus(), importNode()

 WINDOW OBJECTS- It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy.
                The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where 
                as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document
                loaded in that window.
    
     Syntax: window.property_name;

     Properties: Closed,customElements,Document,console,length,fullScreen etc.
     
     Methods: window.method_name;
              alert(), atob(), blur(), open(), close(), moveBy()
